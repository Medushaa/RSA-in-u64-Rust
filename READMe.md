First I implemented the RSA algorithm following the equations in Python, since it'll be easy. 

I used very small sized key values to be able to follow along the process without using complex algorithms that the real RSA uses to calculate faster on verrryyyy HUGE numbers. 

And then I finally implemented it on Rust for speeeeeeed. Could have used BigInt instead of u64, since it has support for these type of calculations. But yeah, same reason as above: To implement the algorithms myself and watch the numbers go brrrr.
